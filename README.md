# Person Sensor Pan/Tilt
Orient a pan/tilt stand to the nearest face using a Person Sensor.

## Introduction

The [Person Sensor](https://usfl.ink/ps) from [Useful Sensors](https://usefulsensors.com)
is a small, low-cost hardware module that detects nearby peoplesâ€™ faces, and
returns information about how many there are, where they are relative to the
device, and performs facial recognition. It is designed to be used as an input
to a larger system, and this example shows how to use it to control a
servo-driven pan/tilt stand so that it always points towards the nearest face.

## BoM

To build this project you'll need:

 - [Raspberry Pi Pico H](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5056).
 - [Person Sensor from Useful Sensors](https://usfl.ink/ps).
 - [Qwiic connector cable with female jumpers](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17261).
 - [Mini Pan-Tilt Kit - Assembled with Micro Servos](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1967)
 - [6 Male to female jumper wires](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9385).
 - Blu Tack or something similar to hold the sensor in place.

No soldering is required. You should be able to use any servo and housing as
alternatives to the kit listed above, it was just chosen because it comes
pre-assembled with all the parts you need. It is pretty light-weight though,
so if you want to move something more than a few tens of grams you may need to
invest in larger servos. You can also use a regular Pico and solder on the
headers yourself if you don't have a Pico H.

## Assembling

### Pan/Tilt Stand

The kit comes pre-assembled, so all you should need to do is attach the servo
cables to the Pico. The cables end in a solid block of female jumper sockets, so
you'll need to plug three male/female jumper wires into each so they can be
attached to non-adjacent pins on the Pico. Once those extension leads are on,
wire each to the following pins:

Pan (lower motor):
 - Black (GND) should go to pin 3.
 - Red (5V) should go to pin 40.
 - Yellow (DATA) should go to pin 1.

Tilt (upper motor):
 - Black (GND) should go to pin 33.
 - Red (5V) should go to pin 39.
 - Yellow (DATA) should go to pin 2.

Pin 39 on the Pico is actually 3.3V, not 5V, but still seems to work as long as
the tilt servo isn't heavily loaded. 

A full wiring diagram is included below.

### Person Sensor

Wiring up the sensor requires 4 jumpers, to connect VDD, GND, SDA and SCL. We're
using I2C port 0, which on the Pico is assigned to GPIO4 (SDA, pin 6) and GPIO5
(SCL, pin 7) in software. Power is supplied from 3V3(OUT) (pin 36), with ground
attached to GND (pin 38). If you're using [Qwiic connectors](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic),
the colors  will be black for GND, red for 3.3V, blue for SDA, and yellow for
SDC. It's the same setup as the [introductory CircuitPython sample code](https://github.com/usefulsensors/person_sensor_circuit_python).

### Wiring

### Mounting

The Person Sensor needs to be mounted on the top plate of the stand, facing in
the same direction as the wires coming out of the pan servo. If you're
actually skilled you can probably do something fancy like 3D printing a part,
but since I'm just a simple CEO I resorted to Blu Tack. The code will always try
to keep the sensor pointing directly at the nearest face, so you can tilt the
mounting of the sensor to control angling of the platform.

## Setting up Circuit Python

You should read the [official guide to setting up CircuitPython on a Pico](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython)
for the latest information, but here is a summary:

 - Download CircuitPython for your board from circuitpython.org. The Pico
 version is available at https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/.
 This project has been tested using the `8.0.0-beta.2` version.
 - Hold down the `bootsel` button on the Pico and plug it into a USB port.
 - Drag the CircuitPython uf2 file onto the `RPI-RP2` drive that appears.

Once you've followed those steps, you should see a new `CIRCUITPY` drive appear.
You can now drag `code.py` files onto that drive and the Pico should run them.

## Install Libraries

We need the [adafruit_motor library](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/motor/en/latest/)
to control the servos for the stand, so the first step is to download a big
bundle of all the CircuitPython libraries from [circuitpython.org/libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).
You'll need to find the right bundle for your CircuitPython version.

Once you have that downloaded, unpack the bundle on your local machine. In the
file viewer, go to the `lib` folder within the unpacked bundle and copy the
`adafruit_motor` directory into the `lib` folder on the `CIRCUITPYTHON` drive.
This should install the library we need to emulate a keyboard.

## Install the Code

Now your carousel is set up, copy the `code.py` file from this repository into
the `CIRCUITPYTHON` drive. You should notice that the green LED on the Person
Sensor lights up when it sees your face, and the stand pans and tilts until it
is facing towards you.

## Next Steps

The algorithm that controls the servos and moves them towards the nearest face
is quite simple, and could be improved if you want smoother animation. Right now
it only updates the position about five times a second, the same rate as the
sensor updates, but you could use much smaller timesteps for the movement to get
less jerky rotation. You could also add in some smoothing to give ease in and
out to make it less robotic.

If you're trying this out with a stand you've built yourself, and you see it
panning or tilting away from you rather than towards you, try changing the sign
of the `PAN_SPEED` or `TILT_SPEED` variables in the code.

We're looking forward to seeing what the creative minds of the maker community
come up with, so please let us know how you get on!
